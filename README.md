# FE21-CR4-MichaelR

For this CodeReview, the following criteria were graded:
- Create a GitHub Repository named: FE21-CR4-YourName. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). Please add a collaborator! See an example of a GitHub link below:
https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git
- Correct HTML, CSS and JavaScript code structure and code indentation
- Correct Bootstrap theme creation based on the provided design
- Correct creation of JSON file to hold movie’s data. Please note that for this task you will provide the object’s data/information. E.g:  
{
    "movieName": "A Star is Born",
    "image": "img/star.jpg",
    "description": "Short description",
    "likes": 0,
   
  }
 
- Correct creation of the HTML/Bootstrap structure based on JavaScript objects. It should be shown on the screen the movie name, a short description, movie poster according to the provided design. Feel free to expand the information as: genre, release date, etc...
- As it is in the example template, there should be a button to every movie that calls a function and it should increment the movie’s “likes” property on every button click.
- Display movie’s “likes” property (number), that is also updated on the screen,after clicking on the button “Like”
 
Bonus Points:
- Add a Sort button that will sort the resulting list of movies according to their current like property status (e.g. show on the top of the list the movie whose like property is currently the highest one).
